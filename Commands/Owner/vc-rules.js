        3. If you are wanting to talk about a topic that is SFW but could still be considered sensitive, make sure to ask people in VC whether they are okay with talking about it first. Tickets from people who were made uncomfortable in VC will be treated the same as if it had happened in text, and you may receive a warning just the same.
        
        4. Mute yourself if need be. If you have to leave the conversation for a bit and there might be loud noises or other people talking about uncomfortable topics in the background, mute yourself. Kids running around or a tv playing is one thing, loud yelling or people talking about NSFW topics is considered another. If you're unsure, err on the side of caution!

We use a redlight system where people can easily indicate when they are less or not at all comfortable with the current line of conversation by posting in this channel. To everyone who is uncomfortable, use this system please!
