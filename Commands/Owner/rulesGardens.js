        ðŸŒ¿1. Respect the TOS and Guidelines of Discord
        
        ðŸŒ¿2. No discriminatory behavior will be permitted (Including but not limited to - slurs, racism, bullying, ableism, and homophobia)
        
        ðŸŒ¿3. Respect the Staff Hierarchy and Staff Members themselves. Any Trolling, Harassment, Disrespect, etc. will result in our Three Strike System which includes us putting a role on you so you don't slip past us.
        
        ðŸŒ¿4. If you are in Littlespace PLEASE do not venture into our NSFW channels. I will not buy the fact that you cannot control where you click. If you have a CG they are responsible for you at that moment when you go into the server. If I see you in a little space in an NSFW channel you will receive a strike. In addition, if anyone sexualizes little space in any way you will be banned. We do not tolerate DDLG, ABDL, or other little space sexualization. This is a safe space.
        
        ðŸŒ¿5. If any NSFW content or symbolism regarding a minor is found in this server, on a member's pfp or name, that member responsible will also be banned. No minor content at all. P3DOs are not tolerated in the slightest.
        
        ðŸŒ¿6. Since this is a server with a focus on dating this must be said-
        
        If you and your partner break up I don't care. If you create the drama of any kind due to a breakup or a rejection you will be kicked from this server. Please keep it to yourselves. No witch hunting. No taking sides. I am here to provide a match-making process not be a relationship counselor.
        
        ðŸŒ¿7. If you are a part of my blacklist you will be banned upon arrival.
        
        ðŸŒ¿8. If you are a PM I will not accept you if you come from the server Cultivities. Due to personal reasons, I prefer those from PMN.
        
        ðŸŒ¿9. Any minor trying to get in will also be banned - this is a server for adults.
        
        ðŸŒ¿10. Please do not discuss any politics or religion in a biased, hateful way. Have debates, but the moment it turns into a fight it will stop
        
        ðŸŒ¿11. Keep all discussions in their appropriate channels!! Talking about weed, go to our MaryJane Fields, talk about NSFW go to our Jasmine Path, etc. 
        
        ðŸŒ¿12. Role Consent is key. RESPECT PEOPLES ROLES!!!
